        <h1>Privacy Policy for Shared Kitchen</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 14.01.2026</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to SharedKitchen! Our app is designed to help you share posts, links, recipes, and ideas in private groups, which we call "Kitchens."</p>
            <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what controls you have over your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect information that is essential to make the app work.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account (either by signing in with Google or registering with an email address), we receive basic profile information (such as your email address, and optionally your name and profile picture). We store this in our database to identify you.</li>
                <li><strong>User Content:</strong> We collect the content you create, which includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The **Kitchens** you create (like the kitchen's name).</li>
                        <li>The **Posts** you make (the description, any link you provide, any image you upload, and your hashtags).</li>
                        <li>The **Comments** you write on posts.</li>
                        <li>The **Likes** you give to posts (we store your User ID in a list on the post).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Information We Don't Collect</h3>
            <p>We do not track your location, your device's advertising ID, or any other personal data not directly related to the app's function.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use your information for one purpose: to run the SharedKitchen app.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To **authenticate** you and log you into your account.</li>
                <li>To **display your content** (posts, comments, likes) to other members of the Kitchens you are in.</li>
                <li>To **show your name and profile picture** next to your posts and comments so other members know who you are.</li>
                <li>To **secure your account** and allow you to manage your content (edit/delete).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
            <p>Your information is shared in a very limited way.</p>
            
            <h3>1. With Other Members of Your Kitchen(s)</h3>
            <p>The entire purpose of this app is to share. Any content you create (posts, comments, likes) inside a specific Kitchen is **visible to all other members of that same Kitchen**. People who are not members of that Kitchen cannot see your content.</p>

            <h3>2. With the Public</h3>
            <p>Your content is **NOT** shared publicly. We do not have a public "explore" page. All content is contained within private Kitchens.</p>

            <h3>3. With Third Parties</h3>
            <p><strong>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.</strong></p>
            <p>We use Google Firebase to power our app. This means our database, image storage, and authentication are hosted by Google. They act as our service provider and have their own robust privacy and security policies.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Your Rights and Data Control</h2>
            <p>You have full control over your content and your account.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Editing/Deleting Content:</strong> You can edit or delete your own posts and comments at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Kitchen Administration:</strong> As a Kitchen Admin, you can remove other members, transfer admin rights, or delete the Kitchen (if you are the last member).</li>
                <li><strong>Leaving a Kitchen:</strong> You can leave any Kitchen at any time (unless you are the last remaining admin).</li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can **permanently delete your entire account** at any time from the Settings page. This will:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Delete your user account from our authentication system.</li>
                        <li>Delete your `user` document from our database.</li>
                        <li>Delete all `posts` you have ever created.</li>
                        <li>Delete all `comments` you have ever written.</li>
                        <li>Delete all images you have ever uploaded.</li>
                        <li>Remove you from the members list of any Kitchens you were in.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>This action is irreversible.</strong> We cannot recover your data once you do this.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Our service is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will do our best to notify you. Continuing to use the app after changes means you accept the new policy.</p>
