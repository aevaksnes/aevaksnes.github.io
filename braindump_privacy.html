    <h1>Privacy Policy for Brain Dump</h1>
    <span class="subtitle">Effective Date: January 13, 2026</span>

    <p>
        aevaksnes ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Brain Dump mobile application (the "Service").
    </p>
    <p>
        This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect different types of information for one purpose: to provide and improve our Service to you.</p>

    <h3>A. Data You Provide Directly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>User Content:</strong> We collect and store the data you explicitly choose to save. This includes custom prompt lists you create and journal entries (dumps) you save to your history. This data is encrypted and stored in your own secure user-specific collection in our database.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. Data We Collect Automatically (via Firebase)</h3>
    <p>When you use our Service, we use Firebase (a Google service) which may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Authentication Data:</strong> When you sign in (using Google Sign-In or Email/Password), we store your email address and a unique User ID (UID). If you use Email/Password, your password is heavily encrypted by Google Firebase; we never see your actual password.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to understand how our users interact with the Service. This helps us fix bugs and improve the app. This data is anonymized and may include your device type, operating system, and in-app events.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Crash & Performance Data:</strong> We use Firebase Crashlytics to identify and fix app crashes. If the app crashes, it may send a report including device information, OS version, and the state of the app at the time of the crash.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service (i.e., to save and retrieve your journal entries and prompts).</li>
        <li>To authenticate you and secure your account so only you can access your private thoughts.</li>
        <li>To identify and fix app crashes and bugs.</li>
        <li>To analyze app usage so we can improve the user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our only third-party service provider is <strong>Google (Firebase)</strong>. We share data with them only to operate the Service. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>authentication data</strong> is managed by Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>saved content</strong> is stored on Google's Cloud Firestore database.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>analytics and crash data</strong> is collected by Firebase.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is processed by Google on our behalf. You can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        The security of your data is critical. We rely on Firebase's robust security measures to protect your information. We have also configured our database (Cloud Firestore) with strict security rules to ensure that <strong>only you can access, read, or write your own data</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Data Rights & Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You have full control over your data. You can delete individual journal entries or prompt lists from within the app at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        To comply with Google Play policies, we provide two ways to permanently delete your account and all associated data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>1. From Within the App:</strong> You can permanently delete your account by navigating to the "Settings" page inside the app and selecting the "Delete Account" option. This happens immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2. Via Email Request:</strong> If you cannot access the app, you can request account deletion by emailing us directly at <a href="mailto:developing.aevaksnes@gmail.com">developing.aevaksnes@gmail.com</a>. We will process your request within 7 days.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that account deletion is permanent and cannot be reversed. We will delete all data associated with your account, including your saved history.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p class="contact">
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us:
    </p>
    <ul>
