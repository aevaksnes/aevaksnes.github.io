            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <section>
            <h2>2. The Service</h2>
            <p>Shared Kitchen provides a platform for users to create and join private groups, which we call "Kitchens," to share content ("Posts"). This content can include text, descriptions, hyperlinks, and images. Users can also comment on Posts and "like" them.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>To use the Service, you must authenticate using your Google Account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your account and for keeping your account access secure. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. User Content and Conduct</h2>
            <p>You are solely responsible for all content you post, upload, or share within any Kitchen.</p>
            
            <h3>Your Content</h3>
            <p>You retain all ownership rights to your content. However, by creating a Post or Comment within a Kitchen, you grant Shared Kitchen a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display, reproduce, and distribute your content *only* within the context of operating the Service and making it available to other members of the Kitchens you have shared it with.</p>

            <h3>Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
            <p>You agree not to post any content that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is illegal, hateful, defamatory, obscene, or discriminatory.</li>
                <li>Harasses, bullies, or intimidates any person.</li>
                <li>Infringes on any third party's intellectual property rights (e.g., posting copyrighted recipes or images without permission).</li>
                <li>Is spam, unauthorized advertising, or "phishing" links.</li>
                <li>Contains software viruses or any other harmful computer code.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Kitchen Administration</h2>
            <p>Each Kitchen is created by a user who is designated as the "Admin." The Admin has special controls over their Kitchen, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to remove any member from the Kitchen.</li>
                <li>The ability to delete any Post or Comment within their Kitchen.</li>
                <li>The ability to transfer admin rights to another member.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are not responsible for the actions of Kitchen Admins. If you are the Admin, you agree to manage your Kitchen in a fair and lawful manner.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Termination</h2>
            <h3>Termination by You</h3>
            <p>You may terminate your account at any time by using the "Delete Account" feature in the Settings page. This action is irreversible and will permanently delete your account, all associated content (posts, comments, images), and your membership from all Kitchens, as described in our Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <h3>Termination by Us</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, without notice, if you are found to be in violation of these Terms.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>
            <p>Shared Kitchen is a platform for user-generated content. We are not responsible for the accuracy, legality, or appropriateness of any content posted by users. You access and use content at your own risk.</p>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, SharedKitchen (and its owners) shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages resulting from the use or inability to use the Service.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. We will do our best to notify you of any significant changes. By continuing to use the Service after changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
